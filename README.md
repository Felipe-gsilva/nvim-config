# my personal nvim config

I use this env for everything in my life, so there are many things I'd like to add here. Such as fixing image and latex rendering, correct some errors with different OS's and desktop envs. 
I'm now testing out hyprland and some glitches (even more than regular) appeared.  

installing this is pretty much just cloning this repo into your ~/.config/ folder and renaming it to ~/.config/nvim

feel free to contribute to this repo or reach me out if you find any bad things
